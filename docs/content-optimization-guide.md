## Content Structure Recommendations

### Paragraph Structure

**Before:**

```text
Long paragraph with multiple ideas that runs on and covers several different topics without clear breaks making it difficult for readers to scan and understand the key points being made which reduces engagement and comprehension.
```

**After:**

```text
Start with your main point in the first sentence.

Keep paragraphs focused on one idea. This makes content easier to scan and understand.

Use short paragraphs for web reading. Most readers scan rather than read every word.
```

### Heading Hierarchy

**Improved Structure:**

```html
<h1>Page Title (Main Topic)</h1>
<h2>Major Section</h2>
<h3>Subsection</h3>
<h3>Another Subsection</h3>
<h2>Next Major Section</h2>
<h3>Related Subsection</h3>
```

### Bullet Points and Lists

**Transform dense paragraphs into scannable lists:**

**Before:**

```text
We offer consulting services including workflow optimization, tech stack consulting, automation and integration, and personalized support with ongoing guidance and troubleshooting as your business evolves.
```

**After:**

```text
Our consulting services include:

• **Workflow optimization** - Streamline your daily operations
• **Tech stack consulting** - Choose the right tools for your needs
• **Automation & integration** - Connect your favorite apps
• **Ongoing support** - Get help as your business grows
