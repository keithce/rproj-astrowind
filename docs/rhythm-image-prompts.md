Looking at your rhythm.astro page, I can identify several strategic places where images would enhance the content and user experience. Here are detailed image prompts for an image generator that align with your site's aesthetic and messaging:

## 1. **Hero Section Background Image**

**Prompt:** "Create a cinematic, moody studio environment with warm golden lighting, featuring professional audio equipment like mixing consoles, studio monitors, and acoustic panels. The scene should have a sophisticated, artistic atmosphere with subtle purple and blue accent lighting, conveying creativity and professional music production. Include subtle musical elements like sheet music or instruments in the background. The style should be modern, clean, and aspirational - perfect for a music finishing service website."

## 2. **Pain Points Section Visual**

**Prompt:** "Design a split-screen illustration showing the contrast between frustration and success in music production. Left side: A musician looking frustrated at their computer/equipment with visible stress, messy studio, and headphones hanging. Right side: The same musician looking confident and satisfied, with a clean, organized studio space and a finished track playing. Use a warm, encouraging color palette with blues, purples, and warm accents. The style should be modern, clean, and relatable to musicians."

## 3. **Keith's Personal Introduction**

**Prompt:** "Create a professional headshot-style portrait of a friendly, approachable audio engineer in his 30s-40s, wearing casual professional attire. He should be in a modern recording studio environment with warm, inviting lighting. The expression should convey expertise, warmth, and approachability. Include subtle studio elements in the background like mixing equipment or acoustic panels. Use a sophisticated color palette with warm tones and professional lighting that matches a music production website aesthetic."

## 4. **Music Production Process Steps**

The overall aesthetic should convey expertise, quality, and professional standards - perfect for showcasing audio engineering capabilities."

## 6. **Before/After Music Quality Visualization**

**Prompt:** "Design a split-screen visualization showing the transformation of music quality. Left side: A messy, chaotic sound wave or frequency spectrum representing 'before' - with jagged lines, noise, and disorganization. Right side: A clean, smooth, professional sound wave or frequency spectrum representing 'after' - with smooth curves, clear separation, and professional polish. Use a color gradient from warm (before) to cool professional blues (after). The style should be modern, technical, and visually appealing to musicians and audio professionals."
