## 1. Project Structure & Organization

- **Follow Astro's Recommended Project Structure**: Utilize the standard
  `src/pages`, `src/layouts`, `src/components`, `src/assets`, and `public`
  directories. [25]
- **Modular Components**: Break down UI into small, reusable components. [8, 31]
  - Consider Atomic Design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates)
    for structuring components, especially for larger applications. [31]
- **Organize by Feature/Domain**: For larger projects, consider grouping related
  components, pages, and utilities by feature or domain to improve
  discoverability and maintainability.
- **Utility Directory**: Create a `src/lib` or `src/utils` directory for shared
  logic, helper functions, and constants. [39]
- **Type Definitions**: Store custom type definitions in a dedicated `src/types`
  directory or within relevant feature/component directories. [14, 39]
- **Configuration Files**: Keep configuration files (e.g., `astro.config.mjs`,
  `tailwind.config.cjs`, `tsconfig.json`) at the project root. [25, 39]
- **Barrel Exports (`index.ts`)**: Use `index.ts` files within directories to
  simplify import paths for modules and components. [39]
- **Path Aliases**: Configure path aliases in `tsconfig.json` (and
  `astro.config.mjs` if needed) for cleaner import statements (e.g.,
  `@components/`, `@lib/`). [39]

## 2. TypeScript Usage

- **Enable Strict Mode**: In your `tsconfig.json`, set `"strict": true` to
  enable all strict type-checking options. [2, 3, 4, 16, 21, 27] This includes:
  - `"noImplicitAny": true` [4, 16]
  - `"strictNullChecks": true` [4, 16]
  - `"strictFunctionTypes": true` [4, 30]
  - `"strictPropertyInitialization": true` [16]
- **Type Everything**:
  - **Component Props**: Always define interfaces or types for your component
    props in both Astro and React components. [14, 40]
  - **Function Parameters and Return Types**: Explicitly type function
    parameters and return values. [4, 5, 13, 17, 30] This improves
    predictability and helps catch errors. [4]
  - **Variables and Constants**: Use type annotations, though leverage type
    inference where it's clear and doesn't sacrifice readability. [5, 9]
- **Avoid `any`**: Minimize the use of `any`. Prefer `unknown` for values whose
  type is genuinely unknown and use type guards to narrow down the type. [1, 7,
  16, 17, 21, 26]
- **Use Interfaces for Object Shapes**: Prefer interfaces over type aliases for
  defining the shape of objects, especially when you expect them to be extended
  or implemented. [4, 6, 13, 30]
- **Utility Types**: Leverage TypeScript's built-in utility types like
  `Partial<T>`, `Readonly<T>`, `Pick<T, K>`, `Omit<T, K>` to create new types
  from existing ones concisely. [1, 4, 9, 17, 28]
- **Enums for Named Constants**: Use enums for sets of named constants to
  improve readability and maintainability. [2, 3, 6]
- **Consistent Naming Conventions**:
  - `PascalCase` for types, interfaces, enums, and class names. [5, 6]
  - `camelCase` for variables, function names, and interface members. [5, 6]
- **Readonly and Immutability**: Use `readonly` modifiers and `ReadonlyArray<T>`
  where appropriate to promote immutability and prevent accidental
  modifications. [17, 26]
- **Type Guards**: Implement type guards for runtime type checking, especially
  when dealing with external data or unions. [17]
- **Astro's `HTMLAttributes`**: Use Astro's `HTMLAttributes` type for prop
  validation against standard HTML attributes. [40]

## 3. Component Development (Astro & React)

- **Astro Components (`.astro`)**:
  - Keep component logic in the frontmatter script section.
  - Use scoped styles (`<style>`) by default for encapsulation. [25]
  - Leverage Astro's partial hydration directives (`client:load`, `client:idle`,
    `client:visible`, `client:media`, `client:only`) judiciously to ship minimal
    JavaScript. [8, 29, 41] Over-hydration negates performance benefits. [8]
- **React Components (`.tsx`)**:
  - Use functional components with Hooks.
  - Ensure React components are hydrated only when necessary using Astro's
    client directives.
  - Follow React best practices for state management, side effects, and
    component composition.
- **Props**:
  - Clearly define and type component props. [14, 40]
  - Use descriptive prop names.
- **Slots (Astro)**: Utilize slots for content projection and creating flexible
  layouts.
- **Accessibility (A11y)**:
  - Use semantic HTML. [33]
  - Implement ARIA attributes where necessary. [33]
  - Ensure keyboard navigability for interactive elements. [33]
  - Consider `prefers-reduced-motion` for animations. [31]

## 4. Styling (Tailwind CSS)

- **Utility-First**: Embrace Tailwind's utility-first approach for styling
  directly in your markup. [33]
- **Configuration (`tailwind.config.cjs`)**:
  - Customize your theme (colors, spacing, fonts) in `tailwind.config.cjs` to
    maintain consistency. [33]
  - Use `theme.extend` for adding custom utilities or overriding defaults.
- **Readability**:
  - Group related utility classes for better readability.
  - Consider using Prettier plugins for Tailwind CSS to automatically sort
    classes.
- **Component Classes**: For complex or frequently reused combinations of
  utilities, consider extracting them into component classes using Tailwind's
  `@apply` directive _sparingly_ within global CSS or component-specific style
  blocks. Be mindful that overuse of `@apply` can negate some of Tailwind's
  benefits. [33]
- **Purging**: Ensure Tailwind CSS is configured to purge unused styles in
  production builds (Astro handles this well by default with the Tailwind
  integration).
- **Global Styles**: Use a global CSS file (e.g., `src/styles/global.css`) for
  base styles, CSS variables, and font imports. [25]

## 5. Data Handling & Validation (Zod, Notion API)

- **Zod for Validation**:
  - Define Zod schemas for all external data sources (Notion API, form
    submissions, etc.) to ensure data integrity. [15, 21]
  - Use Zod schemas to validate API responses and request payloads.
  - Keep Zod schemas modular and reusable. [15]
  - Parse data at the boundaries of your application (e.g., when fetching data
    or receiving user input).
- **Notion API Interaction**:
  - Create dedicated modules or services for interacting with the Notion API.
  - Type API responses using Zod schemas.
  - Handle API rate limits and errors gracefully (e.g., with retries and
    exponential backoff if appropriate). [11]
  - Store API keys and sensitive credentials securely using environment
    variables (see Security section). [21, 24, 35]
- **Data Fetching in Astro**:
  - Use `Astro.glob()` for local file data. [14, 33]
  - Fetch data in component frontmatter for server-rendered pages.
  - For dynamic client-side data, fetch within React components or use
    client-side scripts.
- **Type Safety with Fetched Data**: Ensure fetched data is correctly typed,
  ideally inferred from Zod schemas.

## 6. Performance Optimization

- **Astro's Strengths**:
  - **Zero JS by Default**: Astro ships minimal to no JavaScript by default.
    [34]
  - **Partial Hydration**: Only hydrate interactive components when necessary.
    [8, 29, 41] Avoid over-hydrating. [8]
  - **SSG/SSR**: Leverage Astro's ability to pre-render pages to static HTML
    (SSG) or render on demand (SSR) for fast load times. [8, 29]
- **Image Optimization**:
  - Use Astro's built-in `<Image />` component or `@astrojs/image` integration
    for optimized images (responsive sizes, modern formats like WebP, lazy
    loading). [8, 19, 33, 34]
- **Asset Management**:
  - Place static assets that don't need processing in the `public/` directory.
    [25]
  - Place assets that need processing (e.g., images to be optimized, global CSS)
    in `src/assets/` or `src/styles/`. [25]
- **Code Splitting**: Astro performs code splitting automatically. [8, 19]
- **Minimize JavaScript**:
  - Only use client-side JavaScript where interactivity is essential.
  - Defer loading of non-critical scripts. [8, 19]
- **CSS Optimization**:
  - Tailwind CSS with its purging capabilities helps keep CSS bundle sizes
    small.
  - Astro can inline critical CSS. [19]
- **Font Optimization**:
  - Use `font-display: swap` for custom fonts. [8, 19]
  - Consider preloading critical fonts. [31]
- **Lazy Loading**: Lazy load images and other non-critical resources. [19, 34]
- **Caching**: Leverage Vercel's CDN and caching capabilities.
- **Bundle Analysis**: Periodically analyze your bundle sizes to identify
  potential bloat.
- **TypeScript Compilation Performance**:
  - Prefer interfaces over complex intersection types where possible. [13, 30]
  - Add explicit type annotations, especially for return types, to reduce
    compiler work. [13, 30]
  - Configure `tsconfig.json` appropriately (e.g., `skipLibCheck` can speed up
    builds but use with caution). [30]
  - Use incremental builds (`"incremental": true` in `tsconfig.json`). [13, 28]

## 7. Security

- **Environment Variables**:
  - Store all sensitive information (API keys, secrets) in environment
    variables. [21, 24, 35]
  - Use Vercel's environment variable management for production.
  - Do _not_ commit `.env` files containing actual secrets to version control.
    Use `.env.example` as a template.
- **Input Validation**:
  - Validate **all** user input and data from external sources (e.g., Notion
    API, Resend webhooks) using Zod. [7, 16, 21] This helps prevent injection
    attacks and ensures data integrity.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention**:
  - Astro's templating and UI frameworks like React generally provide good XSS
    protection by default by escaping content.
  - Be cautious when using `set:html` in Astro or `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in
    React. Sanitize any user-provided content before rendering it this way.
- **API Security (Notion, Resend)**:
  - Use HTTPS for all API requests. [21]
  - Follow the principle of least privilege for API tokens. Grant only necessary
    permissions. [11, 35]
  - Securely store and transmit API tokens. [11, 24, 35]
- **Dependency Management**:
  - Keep dependencies (npm packages) up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
    [7, 21]
  - Use tools like `npm audit` or Snyk to check for vulnerabilities. [7]
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Consider implementing a CSP to mitigate XSS
  and other injection attacks. [7]
- **Vercel Security**:
  - Utilize Vercel's built-in security features (e.g., DDoS protection,
    automatic HTTPS).
- **Avoid `eval()` and Dynamic Code Execution**: Do not use `eval()` or similar
  functions with untrusted input. [7]
- **Secure Build Process**: Ensure your build process doesn't introduce
  vulnerabilities. Avoid publishing source maps in production if they reveal
  sensitive original code. [7]

## 8. Error Handling

- **Consistent Error Handling Strategy**: Define a consistent approach for
  handling errors throughout the application.
- **Zod for Validation Errors**: Use Zod's error reporting to provide meaningful
  validation error messages to the user or for logging. [15]
- **API Error Handling**:
  - Gracefully handle errors from the Notion API and Resend (e.g., network
    issues, rate limits, invalid requests). [11, 35]
  - Provide clear feedback to the user when API operations fail.
  - Log detailed error information for debugging. [15]
- **Try-Catch Blocks**: Use `try...catch` blocks for operations that can throw
  errors, especially asynchronous operations. [3]
- **Custom Error Pages (Astro)**: Create custom error pages (e.g., `404.astro`,
  `500.astro`) for a better user experience.
- **Client-Side Error Handling (React)**:
  - Use Error Boundaries in React to catch JavaScript errors in component trees
    and display a fallback UI.
- **Meaningful Error Messages**: Provide clear, user-friendly error messages
  that help users understand what went wrong and how to proceed. [15]
- **Logging**:
  - Implement server-side logging (e.g., via Vercel Functions if used for
    backend logic) for errors and important events.
  - Log validation errors for debugging. [15]
  - Avoid logging sensitive information in error messages. [21]
- **Separate Validation and Runtime Errors**: Handle data validation errors
  differently from unexpected runtime errors. [15]

## 9. Deployment (Vercel)

- **Connect Git Repository**: Connect your Git repository (GitHub, GitLab,
  Bitbucket) to Vercel for automatic deployments.
- **Environment Variables**: Configure production environment variables securely
  in Vercel's project settings.
- **Build Configuration**: Ensure Vercel's build settings are correctly
  configured for your Astro project.
- **Preview Deployments**: Utilize Vercel's preview deployments for every Git
  push to test changes before merging to production.
- **Custom Domains**: Configure custom domains as needed.
- **Monitoring**: Use Vercel's analytics and logging to monitor application
  health and performance.

## 10. Tooling & Code Quality

- **Linters and Formatters**:
  - Use ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript linting. [2, 36]
  - Use Prettier for code formatting. [2, 36]
  - Integrate these tools into your development workflow (e.g., pre-commit
    hooks, editor integration). [31, 36]
- **Astro VS Code Extension**: Use the official Astro VS Code extension for
  optimal editor support (syntax highlighting, TypeScript integration,
  autocompletion). [40]
- **TypeScript Compiler (`tsc`)**: Use `astro check` or `tsc --noEmit` as part
  of your CI/CD pipeline or pre-commit hooks to catch type errors. [40]
- **Git Hooks**: Use tools like Lefthook or Husky to run linters, formatters,
  and tests before committing/pushing code. [31]
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct regular code reviews to ensure adherence to best
  practices, improve code quality, and share knowledge. [2]
- **Testing**:
  - Write unit tests for utility functions and complex logic. [9, 17, 33]
  - Consider end-to-end tests (e.g., using Playwright or Cypress) for critical
    user flows. [31, 33]

By adhering to these best practices, your team can build a maintainable,
performant, secure, and readable Astro web application. Remember that these are
guidelines, and you may need to adapt them based on your project's specific
evolving needs.
