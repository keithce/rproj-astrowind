Everything is much more intense, feels really expanded on the high end but the low end is still in the middle as I like. Somehow I think now I really understand what you meant you could do with the bass, like round it you said. I have been testing it in different sound systems, and I really love it.'\n##  Who's behindResonant Rhythm?\n##### I'm Keith,\n##### a music-infatuated\n#####  post-production technical director, \n##### audio engineer, and entrepreneur.\n##### I possess an uncanny intuition for anything electronic, and I help artists create music that resonates with their audience.\nThroughout my career, I have seen countless creatives stop short of their potential due to hurdles and knocked confidence at the finishing stage of their music.\nI help musicians succeed by offering my ear and feedback, technical troubleshooting, \nand advice regarding the various aspects \nof the music production process.\nBelieve me when I say you absolutely CAN confidently release that record as a polished, finished masterpiece. The world needs your music!\nIn the same way that all musicians \nrelease unique sounds,\nI also understand that artists \nhave different needs, timescales, goals, \nand styles of working.\nI always meet artists where they are at and take the time to get to know the whole story behind their music. \nWhen we work together I show you the necessary steps to complete your music so you can add them to your skillset and continue using them yourself moving forward.\n## Why Work with me?\n  * My primary goal is to produce music of outstanding quality\n  * Benefit from a wealth of experience across countless music genres\n  * Get bespoke support tailored to YOUR creative needs \n  * Collaborate with an industry-lead technical and musical professional\n  * Throughout all my years in music production, there’s not much I haven't seen in terms of roadblocks to perfecting that final mix (I also know because I've been there myself). \n  * you're just one step away from getting the helping hand you need to help you overcome those hurdles and finally finish that song.\n\n\n'I couldn't be happier with Keith's service. He provided me with very positive and in-depth feedback on my latest song, which has been incredibly helpful in improving my craft. He took the time to understand my needs and personal preferences, which made the experience feel personalized and tailored to my specific goals.'\n## Ready to make the leap?\nWhatever your goal, Resonant Rhythm is ready to help you reach it- YOUR way. Let's work together and help you become a signed artist for your dream label today.\n[ BOOK A CALL ](javascript:WebPlatform.Funnels.show\\('1|14'\\))\n'I highly recommend Keith's services to anyone looking to improve their music. He is a skilled professional who truly cares about his clients, and I am grateful for the guidance he provided me.'\n#### What happens after we have our initial call?\nYou’ll share your track and vision with me during our first call.\nIf we’re a good fit to move forward, I’ll send you a contract and details to make the first payment.\nThen I'll provide a detailed document of feedback for you to get started.\n#### What if I don't feel ready to improve my track yet?\nThere is no time like the present! \nOften, the reason we don't feel ready to take action is because we don't have clear next steps. \nIt's easy to start a project- to complete it is the real victory.\nSo, if you're prepared to take a leap of faith and work together, you'll soon feel confident and excited because you'll see what's truly possible for your music.\n#### How long does it take to complete a song?\nOn average, at a steady pace, a song takes around one month from start to finish, completing the required step once per week.\nHowever, if you have a deadline, we can complete your track as quickly as one week!\nBecause I want to work with dedicated musicians, there is a six-month re-start fee to protect my time and capacity in the contract.\n#### What if I never like my song?!\nIf after giving everything to a track, you just can’t fall in love with it, I'll offer 50% off the initial payment of a new contract to start over on a brand new record.\n#### What's your refund policy?\nIf after the first round of written feedback, you are not satisfied then I will refund the initial payment.\nOnce the project moves beyond this stage no refund will be issued as my time has been invested. \nIf you cancel before the end of the finishing process, you simply will not receive the final master.\n[ START YOUR PROJECT ](javascript:WebPlatform.Funnels.show\\('1|14'\\))\nYour cart is empty [Continue](https://resonantrhythm.com/store)\nShopping Cart\nSubtotal:\nDiscount \nDiscount \nVisitor Information Reporting Allow this website to collect visitor and device info for statistical purposes.\nSave Changes\nView Details\nQuantity\nSold Out\n",

get support with mixing as an additional service if you need it.\n    \n  \n              \n      \n  \n        \n          .wave-4-bottom-0{fill:#FFFFFF;}\n        \n        \n          \n

I possess an uncanny intuition for anything electronic, and I help artists create music that resonates with their audience.\nThroughout my career, I have seen countless creatives stop short of their potential due to hurdles and knocked confidence at the finishing stage of their music. I help musicians succeed by offering my ear and feedback, technical troubleshooting, and advice regarding the various aspects of the music production process. \nBelieve me when I say you absolutely CAN confidently release that record as a polished, finished masterpiece. The world needs your music!\nIn the same way that all musicians release unique sounds, I also understand that artists have different needs, timescales, goals, and styles of working. I always meet artists where they are at and take the time to get to know the whole story behind their music. When we work together I show you the necessary steps to complete your music so you can add them to your skillset and continue using them yourself moving forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n  \n              \n      \n  \n      \n          \n\n              \n                  \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n              \n                  \n      Why Work with me?\n    \n  \n              \n                  \n      My primary goal is to produce music of outstanding qualityBenefit from a wealth of experience across countless music genresGet bespoke support tailored to YOUR creative needs Collaborate with an industry-lead technical and musical professionalThroughout all my years in music production, there’s not much I haven't seen in terms of roadblocks to perfecting that final mix (I also know because I've been there myself). you're just one step away from getting the helping hand you need to help you overcome those hurdles and finally finish that song.\n    \n  \n              \n      \n  \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n    \n  \n      \n          \n\n              \n                  \n       \n        \n              \n            \n          \n    \n  \n              \n                  \n      'I couldn't be happier with Keith's service.
