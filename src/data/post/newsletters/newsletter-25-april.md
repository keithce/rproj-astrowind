# **RProj.ART Newsletter - April 2025**

Dear Readers,

April has been an exciting month filled with travel, learning, and new opportunities that I am eager to share with you.

### Highlights

This month, I had the privilege of attending NAB 2025, an incredible experience filled with innovation and networking opportunities. I want to express my gratitude to everyone who made this event memorable, especially the following:

- Mark Reed
- Andy Jarosz
- Eliot Mack
- David Stump
- Jeff Greenburg

 whose insights and time were invaluable. Friends, I hope to make over time!

My key takeaways include:

- I connected with several industry professionals who are doing remarkable work in the content creation space.
- It was wonderful to catch up with my favorite creators, [Chris B](https://www.youtube.com/@chrisbrockhurst). and [Dunna](https://www.youtube.com/@dunnadidit), who continue to inspire me with their work.
- I discovered [Nomatic Clothing](https://www.nomatic.com/collections/the-outset-collection) at the event; their functional designs for creators on the go impressed me.

### Virtual Production Insights

NAB provided a deep dive into the evolving world of virtual production. Here are some noteworthy developments:

- The latest advancements in XR (Extended Reality) are transforming how we approach production environments.
- A recurring theme was the critical importance of metadata for VFX and accurate rendering.
- Cooke's intelligent lens system is revolutionizing how we capture real-time lens data for post-production.

### New Collaborations on the Horizon

I am thrilled to announce a new partnership with Jetset Cine for motion design collaboration. This opportunity emerged directly from connections made at NAB and represents an exciting new creative direction. We will be working on creating a demo and forming a workflow to capture real-life camera motion, which will later be mapped in rendering. I will share more details about our projects as they develop.

### Italy Vacation Planning

Alongside business, I spent a significant amount of time this month planning our upcoming vacation to Italy. The anticipation of exploring new parts of Italy and immersing in local experiences is truly exciting. From choosing the destinations to finding the best local experiences, planning always comes with its challenges. But I've learned that:
Thorough preparation pays off, even if not everything goes exactly as planned.
Being flexible with your itinerary allows for spontaneous discoveries that often become trip highlights.

### Tech Corner: NAB Revelations

The technology showcased on Day 4 of NAB was particularly impressive:

- Apple Vision technology continues to push boundaries in how we interact with digital content.
- Nuke's "Copy Cat" product demonstrates the growing role of AI in post-production.
- OpenTrackIO in Unreal 5.6 (coming in June) promises to streamline VP workflows in exciting ways.

### Staying Healthy While Traveling

With all the movement between NAB and planning for Italy, maintaining health on the road has become a priority. I've been implementing some strategies that may be helpful for fellow travelers:

- Prioritizing sleep, even when schedules get hectic.
- Finding simple ways to stay active, even in hotel rooms or conference centers.
- Planning meals ahead to avoid relying entirely on convenience options.

### Personal Reflections

On a more personal note, I've been deeply reflecting on the astrological influences of March and April and what they suggest about purpose and direction. This period seems to focus on exploration and discoveryâ€”a 'figuring out ' phase that will continue through September. I find comfort in recognizing these natural cycles of clarity and uncertainty, and I hope you can relate to these personal musings.

### Looking Forward

As we transition into May, I am eagerly looking forward to translating all the inspiration from NAB into concrete projects. The motion design collaboration with Jetset Cine will take center stage, and I am excited to see how it unfolds. I will also be finalizing details for our trip to Italy, which I am sure will be a memorable experience.

I would love to hear about the projects and adventures you have lined up for the coming months. Feel free to reply to this newsletter with your updates.

Until next time,

Keith
