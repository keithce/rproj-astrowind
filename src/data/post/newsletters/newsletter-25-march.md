# RProj.ART Newsletter - March 2025 Edition

Dear Friends,

Welcome to the March edition of the RProj.ART Newsletter! As we transition into spring, I'm excited to share what I've been working on and planning this month. From vacation preparations to technical deep dives, there's been plenty to keep me busy.

## Vacation Planning

This month has involved significant planning for upcoming trips:

- **Italy Adventure:** I've been working through the inevitable trade-offs that come with vacation planning. What experiences do we prioritize? What can we reasonably fit into our schedule? Italy is going to be a fantastic experience, and I am particularly excited for Hugo! It’s a bit difficult to say he’s excited, but at the very least, we are excited to take him international.
- **Mountain Time:** In addition to our international plans, I'm looking into some domestic mountain getaways in Utah and Colorado. Sometimes, the best inspirations come when you change your altitude! You can’t beat the clean air of the mountains in the summer. I think the saying, while I lived in Colorado, was, “They come for the winters and stay because of the summers.”

## Technical Deep Dives

March has been productive on the technical front as well:

- **GitHub Actions Mastery:** I've been getting deep into GitHub Actions, which has included the fascinating challenge of building on older Linux versions. It's been a stark reminder that the real state of software development often involves working with legacy systems rather than always being on the cutting edge.
- **new.email Project:** I've been setting up ConvertKit to deliver this newsletter, exploring ways to enhance delivery and improve the reader experience.
- **Deployment Experiments:** I've been learning about and playing with deployment options on Vercel, comparing it with alternatives like Sevalla. Each platform has its strengths for different types of projects.

## Home & Family

Life doesn't stop for technical projects and vacation planning:

- **Homeownership Adventures:** The joys of owning a house continue - this month featured the unexpected task of replacing our dishwasher. Homeownership always seems to have a surprise waiting around the corner!
- **Hugo's Development:** It's been amazing watching Hugo's significant development lately. He's understanding more complex sequences of events, growing stronger physically, and running with greater independence. His [our] excitement about our upcoming Italy trip is contagious!

## Philosophical Corner

Have you noticed how time seems to be speeding up and behaving strangely lately? I've been reflecting on our perception of time and how it shifts with age, seasons, and focus. It may be the approaching change of seasons or the multiple projects in motion, but there's something interesting happening with how we experience the passage of time. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Do you also feel that time is passing differently? What are your reflections on this topic?

## Looking Forward

As we move into April, I'll be finalizing vacation details, continuing my technical explorations, and preparing for spring projects. I'm particularly looking forward to sharing our travel experiences in future newsletters, and I can't wait for you to hear all about it!

What are you planning for the coming months? I'd love to hear about your projects and adventures. Feel free to reply directly to this email with your thoughts.

Until next time,

Keith
