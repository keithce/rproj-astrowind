Dear Friends,

As winter begins to release its grip and we head toward spring, I hope this
newsletter finds you warm and cozy. February has been a month of reflection,
discovery, and creative exploration for me, and I'm excited to share these
experiences with you.

### The Adventures of Homeownership

Many of you can likely relate to the roller coaster that is owning a home. This
month brought its fair share of challenges, from the seemingly simple task of
selling our dining table before finding a replacement (a scheduling mistake I
won't repeat) to the unexpected saga of troubleshooting our sprinkler system.
What began as an investigation of a few faulty sprinkler heads quickly revealed
a malfunctioning well pump. Once that was fixed, we discovered several faulty
sprinkler heads and a major leak, causing water to stream down our driveway. Ah,
the joys of homeownership! It was all happily fixed as we received a deluge of
rain! The universe's timing really has a sense of humor.

### Reflecting on January's Planning

Despite dedicating significant time in January to mapping out the year ahead,
I've found myself feeling somewhat stuck in executing those plans. Perhaps
you've experienced this too? I've been wondering if the current astrological
patterns might be influencing this sense of stagnation. A reading from Jill
Blumenstock provided some much-needed clarity and a timeline for both personal
growth and broader changes. Sometimes, an outside perspective is exactly what we
need. I had some very interesting ideas during the call, which I wrote and
recorded, so we'll see how they hold up in retrospect.

### Tech Deep Dives

For the technically inclined among you, I spent considerable time exploring
Coolify this month. My journey began with discovering my Proxmox container
needed substantially more RAM as it was continuously swapping memory, causing
significant slowdowns while impressively never crashing.

This led me down several interesting paths:

- Installing GitLab on my network — was a fascinating exercise that gave me a
  newfound appreciation for GitHub's seamless service.
- Deepening my understanding of certificate logins and tokens — an essential
  skill for secure server connections via command line.
- Creating a custom homepage using existing GitHub tools.
- Exploring media management tools like Sonarr, Radarr, and others.

I've also been learning Rust, following the excellent "Let's Get Rusty" YouTube
series that visually walks through the official book. While the language syntax
initially feels clunky, I'm gradually adapting to it. The real-time compilation
messages and linting from the rust-analyzer have significantly improved my
development experience.

### AI & Coding Advancements

Speaking of development, coding tools continue to evolve at a remarkable pace.
Using Cursor has transformed how I approach feature development — rather than
writing every line manually, I can now describe features and watch them
materialize. This allows me to think at a higher level of abstraction, focusing
on how components interconnect within larger systems. I LOVE it! I've always
been a systems guy, holding the big picture in mind while figuring out how to
connect the details.

The coding process has essentially become: describe the desired feature, watch
as it's generated, then debug as needed — with effectiveness varying based on
how common or niche your requirements are. Anthropic's release of their Model
Context Protocol represents a significant breakthrough, enabling real-time
integration of specific documentation into AI models to address issues and
create connections between previously unrelated systems.

The AI landscape continues to expand, with numerous major model releases this
month. While some have been underwhelming, others show genuine promise. I'm
particularly interested in watching how open-source models evolve to compete.

### Rekindling Childhood Passions

On a more personal note, I've created a dedicated space for building Legos,
reconnecting with a childhood passion. There's something deeply satisfying about
the focused attention Lego building requires. The enduring popularity of Legos
is remarkable — I recently watched a fascinating documentary on their history
and cultural significance. This revival was perfectly timed with my birthday
this month when I received several amazing new Lego sets to build! It's been a
joy to rediscover this childhood passion.

### Exploring Music, Mathematics, and Physics

I recently discovered the AMS (American Mathematical Society), opening up a
treasure trove of research papers connecting two subjects close to my heart.
This discovery has inspired me to explore how I might contribute value from my
diverse passions.

I'm particularly drawn to researching the connections between frequency physics,
cymatics (the visualization of sound in nature), and water — which makes up so
much of our physical bodies. I'm fascinated by the mathematics underlying these
vibrational patterns and how they might relate to music composition,
specifically electronic music, that could positively influence our physical
well-being. Let me know if you're interested in following my journey down this
chasm of a rabbit hole.

### Looking Forward

As we move into March, I'll be continuing several of these explorations while
eagerly preparing for spring projects. I'd love to hear what's capturing your
interest these days — feel free to reply to this newsletter with your own
discoveries and pursuits.

Until next month,

Keith
