Dear Friends,

As winter begins to release its grip and we head toward spring, I hope this newsletter finds you warm and cozy. February has been a month of reflection, discovery, and creative exploration for me, and I'm excited to share these experiences with you.

### The Adventures of Homeownership

Many of you can likely relate to the roller coaster that is owning a home. This month brought its fair share of challenges, from the seemingly simple task of selling our dining table before finding a replacement (a scheduling mistake I won't repeat) to the unexpected saga of troubleshooting our sprinkler system. What began as an investigation of a few faulty sprinkler heads quickly revealed a malfunctioning well pump. Once that was fixed, we discovered several faulty sprinkler heads and a major leak, causing water to stream down our driveway. Ah, the joys of homeownership! It was all happily fixed as we received a deluge of rain! The universe's timing really has a sense of humor.

### Reflecting on January's Planning

Despite dedicating significant time in January to mapping out the year ahead, I've found myself feeling somewhat stuck in executing those plans. Perhaps you've experienced this too? I've been wondering if the current astrological patterns might be influencing this sense of stagnation. A reading from Jill Blumenstock provided some much-needed clarity and a timeline for both personal growth and broader changes. Sometimes, an outside perspective is exactly what we need. I had some very interesting ideas during the call, which I wrote and recorded, so we'll see how they hold up in retrospect.

### Tech Deep Dives

For the technically inclined among you, I spent considerable time exploring Coolify this month. My journey began with discovering my Proxmox container needed substantially more RAM as it was continuously swapping memory, causing significant slowdowns while impressively never crashing.

This led me down several interesting paths:

- Installing GitLab on my network — was a fascinating exercise that gave me a newfound appreciation for GitHub's seamless service.
- Deepening my understanding of certificate logins and tokens — an essential skill for secure server connections via command line.
- Creating a custom homepage using existing GitHub tools.
- Exploring media management tools like Sonarr, Radarr, and others.

I've also been learning Rust, following the excellent "Let's Get Rusty" YouTube series that visually walks through the official book. While the language syntax initially feels clunky, I'm gradually adapting to it. The real-time compilation messages and linting from the rust-analyzer have significantly improved my development experience.

### AI & Coding Advancements

Speaking of development, coding tools continue to evolve at a remarkable pace. Using Cursor has transformed how I approach feature development — rather than writing every line manually, I can now describe features and watch them materialize. This allows me to think at a higher level of abstraction, focusing on how components interconnect within larger systems. I LOVE it! I've always been a systems guy, holding the big picture in mind while figuring out how to connect the details.

The coding process has essentially become: describe the desired feature, watch as it's generated, then debug as needed — with effectiveness varying based on how common or niche your requirements are. Anthropic's release of their Model Context Protocol represents a significant breakthrough, enabling real-time integration of specific documentation into AI models to address issues and create connections between previously unrelated systems.

The AI landscape continues to expand, with numerous major model releases this month. While some have been underwhelming, others show genuine promise. I'm particularly interested in watching how open-source models evolve to compete.

### Rekindling Childhood Passions

On a more personal note, I've created a dedicated space for building Legos, reconnecting with a childhood passion. There's something deeply satisfying about the focused attention Lego building requires. The enduring popularity of Legos is remarkable — I recently watched a fascinating documentary on their history and cultural significance. This revival was perfectly timed with my birthday this month when I received several amazing new Lego sets to build! It's been a joy to rediscover this childhood passion.

### Exploring Music, Mathematics, and Physics

I recently discovered the AMS (American Mathematical Society), opening up a treasure trove of research papers connecting two subjects close to my heart. This discovery has inspired me to explore how I might contribute value from my diverse passions.

I'm particularly drawn to researching the connections between frequency physics, cymatics (the visualization of sound in nature), and water — which makes up so much of our physical bodies. I'm fascinated by the mathematics underlying these vibrational patterns and how they might relate to music composition, specifically electronic music, that could positively influence our physical well-being. Let me know if you're interested in following my journey down this chasm of a rabbit hole.

### Looking Forward

As we move into March, I'll be continuing several of these explorations while eagerly preparing for spring projects. I'd love to hear what's capturing your interest these days — feel free to reply to this newsletter with your own discoveries and pursuits.

Until next month,

Keith
