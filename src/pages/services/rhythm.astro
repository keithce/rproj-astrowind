Everything is much more intense, feels really expanded on the high end but the low end is still in the middle as I like. Somehow I think now I really understand what you meant you could do with the bass, like round it you said. I have been testing it in different sound systems, and I really love it.", name: 'Artist 1' }, { testimonial: "I couldn't be happier with Keith's service. He provided me with very positive and in-depth feedback on my latest song, which has been incredibly helpful in improving my craft.
