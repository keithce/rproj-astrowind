          "It's unbelievable how much the song has improved. Everything is much more intense, feels really expanded on the high end but the low end is still in the middle as I like. Somehow I think now I really understand what you meant you could do with the bass, like round it you said. I have been testing it in different sound systems, and I really love it.",
