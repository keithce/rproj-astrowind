    title: "What if I don't feel ready to improve my track yet?",
    description:
      "There is no time like the present! Often, the reason we don't feel ready to take action is because we don't have clear next steps. It's easy to start a project - to complete it is the real victory. So, if you're prepared to take a leap of faith and work together, you'll soon feel confident and excited because you'll see what's truly possible for your music.",

    title: 'How long does it take to complete a song?',

      'On average, at a steady pace, a song takes around one month from start to finish, completing the required step once per week. However, if you have a deadline, we can complete your track as quickly as one week! Because I want to work with dedicated musicians, there is a six-month re-start fee to protect my time and capacity in the contract.',

    title: "What's your refund policy?",
    description:
      'If after the first round of written feedback, you are not satisfied then I will refund the initial payment. Once the project moves beyond this stage no refund will be issued as my time has been invested. If you cancel before the end of the finishing process, you simply will not receive the final master.',
