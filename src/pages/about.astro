      <p class="text-lg mb-6">My story with all things music began by listening to classical music at home as a child. I learned to play the violin and read music by age six, then moved on to learn the flute.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">I liked my music teachers, and building a positive relationship with them helped my relationship with music get off to a strong start. When I joined my school's band, the conductor immediately saw potential in me and encouraged me to move from flute to oboe.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">Once again, I had a great teacher who I continued learning from right into my teenage years. She urged me to try out for the city's Youth Symphony, where I got the place of First Chair Oboe, and I enjoyed making collective music with the Symphony for about three years.</p>

    subtitle="Finding New Rhythms"
    content={`
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">When I was about 16 years old, my oboe teacher sadly passed away. This was a contributing factor to my losing the drive to play music. Around this time, I got into video games and also started rowing.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">We were competing statewide as a rowing team and did really well. I'm ambidextrous, so I was asked to row on both sides of the boat, and at the front to set the rhythm for the rest of the team. Those years of rowing helped develop my sense of rhythm and so contributed to my future career in electronic music.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">Then, one day, I didn't warm up properly before a race and tore several muscles in my back, which abruptly ended my rowing. During the weeks at home recovering, I spent time playing computer games and discovered electronic music through online streams of Daft Punk and Eiffel 65, opening up a whole new musical world for me.</p>

      <p class="text-lg mb-6">In 2015, I started to feel burnt out from my engineering career. I was still listening to electronic music daily - it helped me focus, and my friends always asked me for music recommendations.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">That year, for my birthday, a friend booked time in a studio so we could listen to our favorite music on world-class speakers. I remember looking at this vast analog board and asking the audio assistant questions. When he said he was studying audio engineering in Denver, it was a lightbulb moment for me!</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">I didn't even know audio engineering was a thing! I had spent my career studying computer engineering but had yet to hear of audio engineering. It seemed like the perfect combination of music and electrical engineering, and I knew I needed to understand it.</p>

    content={`
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">I started learning everything I could about audio engineering. I was ready to leave Colorado at this point, and with the help of a career coach, I got an apprenticeship at Robert Lang Studios in Seattle, which is famous for producing grunge rock.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">I lived in Lang's spare room for about a year and worked in the studio day and night. When I finally moved into my own apartment, I slowly acquired gear to mix at home in the evenings when I returned from the studio.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">This is when Resonant Rhythm was born. I named my business Resonant Rhythm because it illustrates the physics of what happens when things resonate with us, and when we are moved by music. My vision is to help artists create sound that does just that.</p>

    subtitle="My Creative Philosophy"
    content={`
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">Musically, 'to resonate' means to be filled with or to produce a deep, full, or reverberating sound. When things resonate with you, you feel them. Literally. In the cells of your body. It's why glass shatters when a note vibrates at a specific frequency.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">So when you love the colors in a picture, a design that works, or a film that moves you, it illustrates the very physics of resonance. At Resonant Rhythm, I want to help people create art that resonates deeply with them and others.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">As my own resonance with different creative art forms has evolved, Resonant Projects was born. The more artists I can help on their journey of resonance, the more impact they can have in the world through their creations.</p>
